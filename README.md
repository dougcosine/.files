# .files

This branch is intended for my vim configuration files.
At the moment it is for Windows gVim specifically.
I'm not sure whether I will make a separate branch for other operating systems in the future.

I am currently working through Steve Losh's "Learn Vimscript the Hard Way" and it is playing a large part in the development of my vimrc.
I use the Dvorak keyboard layout, which is why some of my mappings might look strange.

Feel free to use this vimrc as is or with whatever changes you see fit to make.
